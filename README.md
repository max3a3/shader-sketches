# Shader Sketches

### Getting Started

This project is using [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch) which allows you to scaffold and run sketches.

1. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

2. Install dependencies `npm install`

3. Run `npm start sketches/<sketch_filename>` to start a sketch. eg: `npm start sketches/sdf-fogged-glass`

This will start a development server with features such as live-reloading, export, etc. For more info, see [Installing and Using canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch/blob/master/docs/installation.md)
